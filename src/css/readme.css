✦ P R I M A R Y ✦

an Obsidian Theme by Cecilia May

────────────────────────────────────

A combination of Bauhaus, Scandinavian
and yellowing magazine pages as palette
inspiration—Primary is a theme for people
looking for a certain nostalgic warmness.

It is toppled with functional pop
of red blue yellow colors.
The perfect mix of loud and reserved.

Playful, reminiscing, productive.

Obsidian October 2021 Best Theme 🏆
